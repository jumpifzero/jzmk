Firmware for an ATmega32u4 based mechanical keyboard

# About
This is a firmware to run on an ATmega32u4 board, like for example the Arduino Leonardo. 
The keyboard matrix has the rows as input and the columns as output which is the opposite way most keyboard matrices are setup. Also, the columns are connected through a cascade of 3 shift registers (e.g. 74HC595).

# Code
Check the `dev` branch.
